## Assumptions
This case was made for an icebreaker board with the PMOD part removed.

## Tools and parts needed
* Lasercutter
* Acrylic sheet, any thickness (3mm or 1/8" works well)
* 4 M3 nuts
* 4 M3 standoffs (5mm long pref)
* 4 M3 bolts (14mm works well but will need longer if the acyrlic is thicker or standoffs longer)
